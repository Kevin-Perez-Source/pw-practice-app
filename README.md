# 🎭 Playwright Practice Project

This project serves as a hands-on playground for learning [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a modern and powerful test automation framework developed by Microsoft. It uses a lightweight clone of the [Ngx-Admin Angular app](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin) as a mock front-end application to simulate real-world testing scenarios.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository follows along with a comprehensive Udemy course on Playwright. The goal is to build a solid understanding of web automation fundamentals and best practices by applying what’s taught in a structured, progressive way.

All code here is written by me as part of my learning process, including:
- Test scripts
- Page Object Model setup
- Custom utilities and improvements beyond the course

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

By working through this repo, I’m gaining practical experience with:

- ✅ Installing and configuring Playwright from scratch
- ✅ Writing and running Playwright tests via CLI, UI mode, and VSCode extension
- ✅ Locating web elements using Playwright best practices
- ✅ Interacting with a wide range of UI elements:
  - Inputs, buttons, checkboxes, sliders, iFrames, date pickers, etc.
- ✅ Using assertions, handling auto-waiting, and working with timeouts
- ✅ Structuring test projects using the **Page Object Model**
- ✅ Mocking and intercepting **API requests**
- ✅ Shared authentication state between API and UI tests
- ✅ Advanced Playwright topics like:
  - Fixtures, global setup/teardown
  - Parallel test execution and retries
  - Mobile device emulation
  - Visual regression testing
  - Environment variables and Docker integration

## 🧠 Course Structure

The course is structured to progressively build Playwright knowledge from beginner to advanced levels. My commit history reflects that journey — each push typically corresponds to a lesson, concept, or practical implementation.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) (JavaScript)
- Node.js / npm
- Ngx-Admin frontend UI (used for testing only)
